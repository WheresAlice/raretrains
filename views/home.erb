<p>Welcome to Leeds Trains.  To load a summary for a given day, use the following form.</p>
<form>
  <label for="date">Date<input type="date" name="date" value="<%= date %>" id="date"></label><br>
  <label for="station">Station<input type="text" name="station" value="LDS" maxlength="3" size="3" id="station"></label><br>
  <label for="unique">Show only services not appearing yesterday?<input type="checkbox" id="unique"></label><br>

  <button type="button" id="station_button">Display</button>
</form>

<p>This site only covers publicly advertised passenger services in the UK.  Services such as freight, empty carriage movements, and some specials will not appear.</p>

<p>For any given station, you will find listings of operators, origins, final destinations, and platforms in use for the given date.  The data may not always be correct, particularly platform listings.  You should be able to request data as far back as a week and up to 90 days in the future.</p>

<p>Data gets cached forever, but will be erased after 30 minutes of inactivity.  Provided the site continues to see little traffic, this seems to work well.  It may need rethinking in the future.</p>
